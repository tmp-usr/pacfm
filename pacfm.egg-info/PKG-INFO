Description: PACFM: Pathway Analysis with Circos for Functional Metagenomics
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        
        PACFM is a software tool developed for the analysis of
        biological pathways in metagenomics projects. It provides 
        the users with an improved way of visualizing pathway 
        abundance data in addition to presenting a wide array of 
        methods for filtering and normalization.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Mac OSX:

          2. Open a terminal window and type:
            >> tar -xzvf pacfm-0.0.1.macosx-10.11.tar.gz
        
        - Windows:
          
          1. Download the zip file and extract the source files.

          2. Install perl (>= 5.8) 
          
          3. Install the latest wxpython release compatible with 
            your OS, from the following website 
            http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
          
          4. (Required for Circos) Install the perl modules by 
            typing the following in a terminal window :
            >> cpan X::Y::Z
              The module name X::Y::Z is replaced by the folllowing: 
              Config::General, Font::TTF::Font, Math::Bezier, 
              Math::VecStat, Readonly, Text::Format, Statistics::Basic, 
              Set::IntSpan, Regexp::Common, SVG  
          
          5. Clone into the pacfm project on github by typing:
            
            >> git clone https://github.com/ecotox/pacfm/src
            >> cd pacfm
            >> python setup.py install
